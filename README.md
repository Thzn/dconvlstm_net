# dconvlstm_net

This repository contains the code segments from DConv-LSTM-Net: A Novel Architecture for Single and 12-Lead ECG Anomaly Detection, currently in consideration for publication in IEEE Sensors Journal. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning architecture for single and 12-lead ECG anomaly detection, and we evaluate our modals on four publically available datasets. Alongside with specific implementation details for DConv-LSTM-Net, we also provide additional data pre-processing scripts we used and some baseline modals we implemented for benchmarking purposes.
