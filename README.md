# dconvlstm_net

This repository contains the code segments from DConv-LSTM-Net: A Novel Architecture for Single and 12-Lead ECG Anomaly Detection, currently in consideration for publication in IEEE Sensors Journal. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning architecture for single and 12-lead ECG anomaly detection, and we evaluate our modals on four publically available datasets. Alongside specific implementation details for DConv-LSTM-Net, we also provide additional data pre-processing scripts we used and some baseline modals we implemented for benchmarking purposes.

We evaluate our modals on the following datasets, and we perform subject-independent 10-FCV. 

1. PhysioNet-AF dataset
2. CPSC dataset 
3. PTB-XL dataset 
4. Georgia dataset

For all our implementations we use basic/standard Pytorch (1.6.0>) commands, and other than that you don't need to install specific versions. Here, we provide our modal implementation codes, some baselines we implemented for our experiments and data pre-processing scripts we used. We encourage readers to use our modal implementations for their benchmarking purposes.
